# About
I've noticed that website called heroquizz.com which allows you to create 15 question quiz for your friends is spreading really fast. And of course when I first took the test I used inspect tool in chrome and noticed that all of the answers are in the code so I wrote an extension which makes sure that you won't dissapoint your friend with bad score.
